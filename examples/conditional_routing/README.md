# Conditional Routing Example

This example demonstrates advanced conditional routing patterns in LangGraphGo workflows.

## Overview

Shows conditional routing based on:
- Content analysis and classification
- State-based decision making
- Dynamic path selection
- Multi-criteria routing logic

## Running the Example

```bash
cd examples/conditional_routing
go run main.go
```

## Key Features

- **Smart Routing**: Route based on content analysis
- **State Inspection**: Make decisions based on current state
- **Fallback Logic**: Handle edge cases gracefully
- **Multi-Path Workflows**: Support complex branching scenarios

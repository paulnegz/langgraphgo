# Subgraph Example

This example demonstrates how to create and use subgraphs in LangGraphGo for modular workflow design.

## Overview

Shows how to:
- Create reusable subgraph components
- Compose complex workflows from smaller graphs
- Share state between parent and child graphs
- Build hierarchical workflow architectures

## Running the Example

```bash
cd examples/subgraph
go run main.go
```

## Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Break complex workflows into smaller components
- **State Sharing**: Pass state between parent and child graphs
- **Reusability**: Create reusable workflow components
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Build nested workflow architectures
